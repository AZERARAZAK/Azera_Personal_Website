							So, lets start with my dad. His name is Abd Razak Bin Mohamad, he is an ex-army and also ex-police. He is 46 years old now and Alhamdulillah! he still healthy and strong. Next would be my mom, she's already 45 years old and also still healthy until now. My mom's given name is Rustinah Duasang and she change it to Nurrasyidah Binti Abdullah when she convert. Ah ! sorry i forgot to tell my mom is from Sabah and she is dusun.

							Since Im the elderst, I will skip me and procees to my brother, angah. His name is Mohammad Amirul Izzat Bin Abd Razak. We wer so close since a baby to be honest ><! He is 18 years old now. InsyaAllah in this year he will join army recruitment. Pray for him guys!!

						 	Next is my second brother, Mohammad Amirul Ifwat Bin Abd Razak. He is 14 years old and now studying at SMK Felda Purun, Bandar Bera. He's the diligent sibling among all HAHA! Okay now we proceed to my younger sister, which is Nurul Ain Binti Abd Razak. She should be UPSR's candidate this year but since Covid19 effect so bad, theres no way they can do it.

						 	Last but not least, my younger brother Izzul Islam. He is the last child in my family and he is so annoying ! But he's kinda cute so its okayyy ><. Thats all about my family hehe !
